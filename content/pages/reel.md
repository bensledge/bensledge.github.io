            <td rowspan="2">**1 | Character Rigging: "ROBOREPAIR" Short Film**  
                            Designed a fully articulated character rig in Maya. The rig 
                            features the ability to switch between three arm attachments 
                            and FK/IK switching on the arms and legs. When the arms and 
                            legs are in IK mode, the ball joints rotate to keep the limb 
                            in the socket of the ball joints. The rig features a torso 
                            rocker with an arbitrary pivot around the waist.

                Designed and modeled blendshapes. Created animator friendly control

            <td>FINGERMOTION</td>
            <td>**6 | Automatic Finger Animation Research**  
                Implemented a system for automatically generating handover animation
                from wrist movement. Created a database of finger motions from motion
                capture data. Input wrist motion was segmented into motion clips and
                matched with finger motions from the database. This was an
                implementation of "Data-driven Finger Motion Synthesis for Gesturing
                Characters" by Sophie JÃ¶rg et. al. (ACM Transactions on Graphics -
                Proceedings of ACM SIGGRAPH Asia, November 2012).
