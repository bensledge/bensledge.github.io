            <td rowspan="2"><b>1 | Character Rigging: "ROBOREPAIR" Short Film</b>
                            Designed a fully articulated character rig in Maya. The rig
                            features the ability to switch between three arm attachments
                            and FK/IK switching on the arms and legs. When the arms and
                            legs are in IK mode, the ball joints rotate to keep the limb
                            in the socket of the ball joints. The rig features a torso
                            rocker with an arbitrary pivot around the waist.

            <td>FINGERMOTION</td>
            <td><b>6 | Automatic Finger Animation Research</b>
                Implemented a system for automatically generating handover animation
                from wrist movement. Created a database of finger motions from motion
                capture data. Input wrist motion was segmented into motion clips and
                matched with finger motions from the database. This was an
                implementation of "Data-driven Finger Motion Synthesis for Gesturing
                Characters" by Sophie JÃ¶rg et. al. (ACM Transactions on Graphics -
                Proceedings of ACM SIGGRAPH Asia, November 2012).
