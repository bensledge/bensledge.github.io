Greetings! Ben Sledge here. I'm a rigging and technical artist.
I help animation and visual effects companies make compelling characters for
film and video.
When I'm not designing articulation systems or coding deformers, you can find
me exploring the vibrant city of Vancouver and the mountains of beautiful
British Columbia.

Professionally
--------------
As a character technical director and rigging artist, I turn characters
into digital puppets that animators can breathe life into. I center my workflow
around creating scripted rig solutions that are easily updated. In production,
models always change (even well after they're "final"), so rigs always need to
be updated. The more the process is automated, the easier and more accurate
those updates can be.

I'm a pro at Autodesk Maya. I'm very familure with Python scripting (and PyMel)
and plug-in development (in both Python and C++).

For my Master's thesis at Clemson University in 2014, I developed an
object-oriented, modular rigging system in PyMel. The source code is availble
on GitHub.

Since gradutating in 2014, I've been working on artistic and technical elements
of characters for films at MPC and Rainmaker Entertainment in Vancouver.
