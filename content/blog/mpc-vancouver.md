I am very excited to join the film Technical Animation team at [MPC
Vancouver](http://moving-picture.com). MPC is a London based post
production house with offices in London, New York, Montreal,
Vancouver, LA and Bangladore. Their work includes visual effects
for both the advertising and the film industry, with notable work
on Life of Pi, Man of Steal and Guardians of the Galaxy.
The Tech Anim department oversees character effects (hair and
cloth simulations) and shot-by-shot character specific deformations
(skin and environment interactions).
