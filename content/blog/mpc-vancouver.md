I am very excited to join the film Technical Animation team at MPC
Vancouver. MPC is a London based post production house with offices in
London, New York, Montreal, Vancouver, LA and Bangladore. Their work
includes visual effects for both the advertising and the film industry,
with notable work on Life of Pi, Man of Steal and Guardians of the
Galaxy. The Tech Anim department oversees character effects (hair and
cloth simulations) and shot-by-shot character specific deformations
(skin and environment interactions).
