A lot of hard work and crazy hours went in to creating the visual effect
for Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb. It's no surprise the film
[made the short-list for the 2014 Oscar for Visual
Effects](http://www.oscars.org/news/10-contenders-remain-vfx-oscarr-race-0).
I was lucky enough to spend a short amount of time on the show, and I
know first hand the amount of effort that went into every shot. Check
out the trailer below (and watch for the costume I helped create around
1:09).
