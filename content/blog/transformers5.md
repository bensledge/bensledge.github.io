I had the privilege of joining the ILM Vancouver creature department just in
time to help finish _Transformers: The Last Knight_. I worked on in-shot
simulations for the bits and bobs that hang off the robots. Most of my work was
in the junkyard sequence and a couple of shots towards the beginning of the
film. And I got to help on Optimus Prime for a shot in the trailer below
(around the 1:48 mark).
