_Rainmaker Entertainment: Where worlds are created._

After a few months at MPC Vancouver, it was time to move on and find a
new home in the animation/computer graphics industry. A new home that
happens to be in the crazy talented rig department at [Rainmaker
Entertainment](http://rainmaker.com).

Rainmaker is one of the oldest 3D animation studios in existence. They
were founded as Mainframe back in 1991, when they produced the first
computer generated TV show
["Reboot."](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReBoot) Since then, they've
worked on everything from the Beast Wars show to the Barbie DVDs.
They're currently working on the 23rd installment of the Barbie
franchise for Mattel, a new Bob the Builder TV show and a project for
Sony Animation.
