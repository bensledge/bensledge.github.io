_Remnant: Wing rigged in Maya using nCloth._

This Maya nCloth rig was created to help artists pose angle wings for
[Matt Via](http://www.matthewvia.com/)'s game project "Remnant."
Using a combination of cloth, joints and painted weight maps,
I created a prop rig used to animate these larger-than-life wings.
The gravity, mass and input attract could be tuned to achieve the desired look.
