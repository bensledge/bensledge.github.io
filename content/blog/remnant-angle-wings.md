##Remnant: Wing rigged in Maya using nCloth.
This Maya nCloth rig was created to help artists pose angle wings for
[Matt Via](http://www.matthewvia.com/)'s game project "Remnant." Using a combination of cloth, joints
and painted weight maps, I created a prop rig used to animate these
larger-than-life wings. The gravity, mass and input attract could be
tuned to achieve the desired look.
