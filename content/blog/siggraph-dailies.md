We just received official word the film we worked on over the summer at Clemson University with
DreamWorks Animation 
([ROBO+REPAIR](http://bensledge3d.com/portfolio/roborepair/ "ROBO+REPAIR"))
and the film the other team worked on
([QA-ARM-A](http://vimeo.com/87516077)) were both accepted into the
[2014 SIGGRAPH Dailies](http://s2014.siggraph.org/attendees/dailies)
program. It is an honour to have our work shown as part of the international 
conference in Vancouver in August.

Way to go Team Jarvis and Team Megazord!
