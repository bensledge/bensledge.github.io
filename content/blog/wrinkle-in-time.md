Based on Madeleine L'Engle's beloved children's book, _A Wrinkle in Time_
follows Meg, Calvin and Charles Wallace through time and space to try and save
Meg's father. Industrial Light and Magic was tasked with fulfilling director
Ava DuVernay's vision for the planet Uriel. On the creature team, we were
responsible for creating Mrs. Whatsit in her flying form; and digital doubles of
the kids. Personally, I worked on the animation/deformation rig for the flying
Mrs. Whatsit, the cloth rig for Meg, and simulation shot work through our
sequence. Check out the trailer below (at 1:43 there's a great shot of our
work).
