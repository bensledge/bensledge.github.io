_OpenGL / GLSL Render of the Utah Teapot._

I worked with a team of three other students to create an OpenGL render
of the Utah Teapot. We implemented a shader in OGSL that made use of
painted texture, bump and specular maps. My responsibilities included
writing code to calculate and store face normals and the generation of
bump maps.
