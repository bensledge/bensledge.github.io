"The Water is Always Bluer" is an animated short film about a rubber
duck bored with his life in the bathtub. When he gets his chance to
escape, he realizes maybe his life wasn't so bad after all. "The Water
is Always Bluer" was an official selection of the Greenville
International Film Festival 2013, the Charleston International Film
Festival 2013 and the Blue Plum Animation Festival 2013. I was
responsible for creating the character rig for the iconic rubber duck
character. I also worked on modeling, surfacing and lighting for this
show.

Our story follows a lovable rubber duck through an unexpected journey .
We first join our hero in his bathtub, waiting for yet another bath. In
utter boredom he looks down, looking for his reflection in the water.
Instead, he finds a portal to another world. He dives in and resurfaces
in a swimming pool. He's so excited he doesn't see a beach ball headed
straight for his head! He continues flipping forward into increasingly
dangerous situation, until he lands in the bottom of a dried-up well. I
won't give all the story away, but he does make it home in the end.

The rubber duck rig uses an FK body setup to control the character's
silhouette. To match the expressiveness in the concept art, we decided
to use free-floating transform controllers for the eyebrows. The duck's beak and
facial expressions were applied via blendshapes to give us absolute
control over the final look of the mesh.

I also developed the texture and lighting for the sequence where the
duck is at the bottom of the well. These shots form the emotional low
point of the film, so we wanted to use darker, less optimistic tones.
When the well starts to fill with rain water, we started to increase the
overall brightness of the shots to underscore the ducks returning hope.

The film was well received at regional animated short film festivals and
we co-opened the 2013 [Greenville International Film
Festival](http://www.gviff.org/) with Fire on the Water. [Karen

Coley](http://kaceycoley.com/), Zhaoxin Ye and Yujie Shu were awesome to
work with.
