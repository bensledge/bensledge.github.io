ROBO+REPAIR is a 15 second animated short completed as part of the
DreamWorks Animation Summer Industry Course at Clemson University. I was
on a team of five students who wrote and produced a short film about a
robot looking to repair his broken arm.

As pipeline lead I helped my team by designing a referencing scheme for
Maya and by developing automated scripts to improve workflow. I also
served as my team's go-to for fixing those weird problems that come up
during production (like geometry suddenly exploding during animation or
textures not showing up in renders).

As rigging lead I rigged the robot character and center console. The
robot has a torso rocker control with an arbitrary pivot, a double knee
and full fk/ik switching on it's arms and legs (did I mention it has
four arms?).

The incredably talented Team Jarvis also included [Alex Beaty](http://www.alexbeaty.com/) (director, layout, animation), [Mandy Morland](https://mmorlandportfolio.wordpress.com/)
 (FX, modeling, motion graphics), [Zhaoxin Ye](https://zhaoxiny.com/) (modeling, surfacing, lighting) and [Ashley Anderson](https://vimeo.com/user30194358) (design, surfacing, lighting).

ROBO+REPAIR was accepted into the 2014 SIGGRAPH Dailes.
