time to help finish &lt;em&gt;Transformers: The Last Knight&lt;/em&gt;. I worked on in-shot
simulations for the bits and bobs that hang off the robots. Most of my work was
in the junkyard sequence and a couple of shots towards the beginning of the
film. And I got to help on Optimus Prime for a shot in the trailer below
(around the 1:48 mark).&lt;/p&gt;

invoicing system. It combines kanban based ideas and advanced reporting
to help managers and designers manage workloads and monitor the progress
of an entire team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job Tracking:&lt;/strong&gt; The Job Queue provides an at-a-glance snapshot of
    who's working on what and when everything is due.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Templating:&lt;/strong&gt; Product templates allows managers to save
    the production information for frequent jobs to reduce error on
    repeat orders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatic Billing:&lt;/strong&gt; Every Product carries all the pricing info
    needed to quote and bill jobs, so creating a quote or an invoice
    becomes a one-button operation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waste Tracking:&lt;/strong&gt; Detailed waste reports help track exactly where
    efficiency needs to be improved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agregated Reporting:&lt;/strong&gt; A Python based reporting system allows an
    unlimited varriaty of views in to production and cost data.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wibo is built on the Django framework for Python web development and is
accessed directly through a browser. On the front end, it uses Twitter's
Bootstap to create a familiar and responsive interface for users (that
works great on both desktops and mobile devices).&lt;/p&gt;

DreamWorks Animation Summer Industry Course at Clemson University. I was
on a team of five students who wrote and produced a short film about a
robot looking to repair his broken arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As pipeline lead I helped my team by designing a referencing scheme for
Maya and by developing automated scripts to improve workflow. I also
served as my team's go-to for fixing those weird problems that come up
during production (like geometry suddenly exploding during animation or
textures not showing up in renders).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As rigging lead I rigged the robot character and center console. The
robot has a torso rocker control with an arbitrary pivot, a double knee
and full fk/ik switching on it's arms and legs (did I mention it has
four arms?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incredably talented Team Jarvis also included
&lt;a href="http://www.alexbeaty.com/"&gt;Alex Beaty&lt;/a&gt; (director, layout, animation),
&lt;a href="https://mmorlandportfolio.wordpress.com/"&gt;Mandy Morland&lt;/a&gt; (FX, modeling, motion graphics),

&lt;p&gt;"The Water is Always Bluer" is an animated short film about a rubber
duck bored with his life in the bathtub. When he gets his chance to
escape, he realizes maybe his life wasn't so bad after all. "The Water
is Always Bluer" was an official selection of the Greenville
International Film Festival 2013, the Charleston International Film
Festival 2013 and the Blue Plum Animation Festival 2013. I was
responsible for creating the character rig for the iconic rubber duck
character. I also worked on modeling, surfacing and lighting for this
show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our story follows a lovable rubber duck through an unexpected journey .
We first join our hero in his bathtub, waiting for yet another bath. In
utter boredom he looks down, looking for his reflection in the water.
Instead, he finds a portal to another world. He dives in and resurfaces
in a swimming pool. He's so excited he doesn't see a beach ball headed
straight for his head! He continues flipping forward into increasingly
dangerous situation, until he lands in the bottom of a dried-up well. I
won't give all the story away, but he does make it home in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rubber duck rig uses an FK body setup to control the character's
silhouette. To match the expressiveness in the concept art, we decided
to use free-floating transform controllers for the eyebrows. The duck's beak and
facial expressions were applied via blendshapes to give us absolute
control over the final look of the mesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also developed the texture and lighting for the sequence where the
duck is at the bottom of the well. These shots form the emotional low
point of the film, so we wanted to use darker, less optimistic tones.
When the well starts to fill with rain water, we started to increase the
overall brightness of the shots to underscore the ducks returning hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film was well received at regional animated short film festivals and
we co-opened the 2013 &lt;a href="http://www.gviff.org/"&gt;Greenville International Film
Festival&lt;/a&gt; with Fire on the Water. &lt;a href="http://karenstritz.com/"&gt;Karen
